# Interactive component
  
This scatter plot helps to look into the third research question in our project: What is the most likely time period for a long distance ride?  
  
Since the dataset is so large, we will only be focusing on the trip data that has LaGuardia airport as the dropoff destination.  

For the interactive component, we made an interactive scatterplot. Simply hover over one of seven options on the “Day of week” color legend, then the trip data for a specific day of the week will show clearly.
